## A beginning.

Conventional wisdom tells soon-to-be new parents to get ready for many restless nights. While there's an increasing number of baby monitors, there lacks products that can help parents intelligently understand and manage their newborn's sleep.    

## A middle.

While there are many of parenting books on tactics for helping a baby get to sleep and stay asleep, they largely fall into a paradigm of behavioral sleep interventions that may modestly increase the length of time an infant sleeps at night without signaling. A recent systematic literature review has concluded that while existing behavioral sleep interventions, and parental practices that are modeled on behavioral approaches, have been associated with modest increases in self-settling and in infant sleep duration, they have not been shown to decrease infant crying, to prevent sleep and behavioral problems in later childhood. (Douglas&Hill, 2013) The Possums Sleep Intervention (Whittingham&Douglas, 2014) is a new approach to infant sleep problems that is grounded within contextual behavioral science, cued care, and the biology of sleep. The aim is not to maximize the duration of the infant’s nocturnal sleep but to support the healthful biological regulation of sleep as well as to optimize the infant's sleep efficiency and resilience. 

To implement the PSI, I want to create a platform that can aggregate data collected from wearable devices, computer vision and audio processing aimed at:
1) Help parents identify obstacles to healthy regulation of infant Sleep (e.g. disrupted circadian pacemaker, infant feed problems)
2) Teach new parents that cued-care is a pattern of care characterized by intentionally and sensibly responding to their baby’s cues

## An end.

The Possums Sleep Intervention was developed from scientific literature. Although it is relatively new, there has been ongoing clinical practice, health practitioner education, and scientific research occurring in tandem, reinforcing and informing each other. Rather than promoting one-way parents enforced and potentially harmful sleep intervention actions, the platform draws from PSI principles to promote flexible, values-driven actions to increase positive reinforcement.
