### Optimize Baby Sleep

Parents have trouble managing newborns’ sleep patterns. There are existing resources - such as the Possum's Sleep Intervention - to help parents diagnose these cues and take action, but most new parents aren’t familiar with the PSI. Enter "SleepBaby!", which automatically identifies these cues and suggest actions to take.
