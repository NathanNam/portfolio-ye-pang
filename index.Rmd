# Welcome! {-}

This site contains my portfolio projects from "Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis" class as part of the UC Berkeley MIDS program. Currently, this involves only conceptual ideas, with more updates to come. 

<!-- You can include images saved within your repo... -->
```{r hello-world,echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Hello World!',fig.align='center',out.width='50%'}
#knitr::include_graphics('img/hello-world.png')
```

<!-- Below this line is just examples of how you can embed video from Google Drive. First you have to enable sharing, then just get the object ID which is that long string between d/ and /preview and will also be appended to any sharing link you generate for your video. -->

### Optimize Baby Sleep {-}

Parents have trouble managing newborns’ sleep patterns. There are existing resources - such as the Possum's Sleep Intervention - to help parents diagnose these cues and take action, but most new parents aren’t familiar with the PSI. Enter "SleepBaby!", which automatically identifies these cues and suggest actions to take. 


### Intelligent Insurance Fraud Detection {-}

The insurnace indsutry has traditionally relied on special investigation units (SIU) and "red flags" to combat fraud. However, these rule based detection systems are extremely delicate and difficult to maintain. Even with very costly experts paid to tune and keep these systems up-to-date, there remain both human errors and subjective biases that could lead to underperformance and ultimately impact bottom line results. Enter "FraudZoom", which leverages data science and offers alternative ways to detect insurance fraud that are more intelligent, cheaper, and faster to execute.
