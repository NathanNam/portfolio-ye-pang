This site contains my portfolio projects from “Research Design and Applications for Data and Analysis” class as part of the UC Berkeley MIDS program. Currently, this involves only conceptual ideas, with more updates to come. Add Video… Figure .: Vote For SleepBaby! Optimize Baby Sleep Parents have trouble managing newborns’ sleep patterns. There are existing resources - such as the Possum’s Sleep Intervention - to help parents diagnose these cues and take action, but most new parents aren’t familiar with the PSI. Enter “SleepBaby!”, which automatically identifies these cues and suggest actions to take. Intelligent Insurance Fraud Detection The insurnace indsutry has traditionally relied on special investigation units (SIU) and “red flags” to combat fraud. However, these rule based detection systems are extremely delicate and difficult to maintain. Even with very costly experts paid to tune and keep these systems up-to-date, there remain both human errors and subjective biases that could lead to underperformance and ultimately impact bottom line results. Enter “FraudZoom”, which leverages data science and offers alternative ways to detect insurance fraud that are more intelligent, cheaper, and faster to execute. About Me Kevin is a data scientist at QBE Insurance Group working on claims analytics. He’s also curently pursuing a graduate degree from UC Berkeley’s MIDS program. In his spare time, Kevin likes to experiment with technology and try new things. Updated: 2017-11-28 "],

Parents are presented today with an ever-increasing number of baby monitors, however, there aren’t any products today that can help parents intelligently understand and manage their newborn’s sleep. The Possums Sleep Intervention (PSI) is a new approach to infant sleep problems that is grounded within contextual behavioral science, cued care, and the biology of sleep. The aim is to support the healthful biological regulation of sleep as well as to optimize the infant’s sleep efficiency and resilience. (Whittingham&amp;Douglas, 2014) 1.2 KEEP IT TOGETHER! With PSI acting as guiding principles, I want to use a suite of technologies (e.g. wearable devices, computer vision, and audio processing) to collect and aggregate data into a cross-platform app and in turn use machine learning to make recommendations to parents aimed at: Identify obstacles to healthy regulation of infant sleep (e.g. disrupted circadian pacemaker - obtaining sunlight in the morning; feed problems - excessively frequent feeds and associated excessive night-waking in breast-fed babies) Reinforce that cued-care is a pattern of care characterized by intentionally and sensibly responding to their baby’s cues. On the other hand, responding to the baby’s cues in a manner that is not what baby intends, with the aim of extinguishing signaling, is not cued care. The full list of PSI targeted intervention actions can be found in Whittingham’s paper, while there are many that can be easily checked, there will be technical challenges to recognize baby cues correctly and determine the best response. Fortunately, with the power of machine learning (limited by how much training data is available) coupled with computer vision to analyze baby’s physical cues, a good recommendation can often be approximated with high accuracy to be shared with the new parents. Parents will also have the option to tweak the model by relabeling captured cues to reduce false positive rate. 1.3 ALL IS WELL! PSI was developed from scientific literature. Rather than promoting one-way parents enforced and potentially harmful sleep intervention actions (e.g. ignore pre-cry or cry cues; decouple sleep from feeds and bodily contact; fit their infant’s sleeping patterns to the average; lists of tired cues without understanding of context), my app aims to fully implement the PSI and provide an intuitive graphical user interface to promote flexible, value-driven actions to increase positive reinforcement.

["fraudzoom.html", "2 FraudZoom 2.1 pitfalls of rules engine 2.2 data science driven 2.3 intelligent fraud detection", " 2 FraudZoom 2.0.0.1 Keywords insurance, fraud detection, SIU, claims analytics, claimant fraud, machine learning 2.1 pitfalls of rules engine Today, property &amp; causulty insurance carriers have an increasing demand to reduce claim costs (through loss avoidance) with anti-fraud initiatives across business lines (e.g., auto, property, liability, and worker’s compensation). While smaller insurers mostly rely on claims adjusters to manually (but proactively) make referrals to special investigations unit (SIU) departments, larger insurers have turned to IT to develop rule-based systems that can assign fraud scores (i.e., add up all fired rules’ weighted scores to see if they are over a threshold) to claims and generate leads for SIU. However, these systems often feel inadequate and can have an overly manual, imprecise, and expensive process to create/update the rules and their associative weights when fraud pattern changes. With the help from data scientists, there are in fact more automated and intelligent approaches to generate these leads to SIU more reliably without overtaxing claims adjusters or having huge IT budgets. 2.2 data science driven When a large number of rules (usually in the thousands) are involved, it is next to impossible for a human to know what is the “correct” weight to use for each of the rules. Subjective manual adjustments made to “tweak” the overall score are usually biased and suboptimal. There are in fact a couple ways data science can improve on the rule-based approach: If the problem is linearly solvable, (i.e., plane exists to separate the fraudulent from non-fraudulent claims), an algorithm called “perceptron” can be used to optimize the rule weights automatically to maximize a choice of statistical measure (e.g., Recall, Precision, or F1) Regularization can also be applied during optimization to ensure that impactful rules receive more weights and trivial/outdated rules can be easily found and corrected. In practice, fraud detection is likely a non-linear problem, machine learning models like the support vector machine, random forest, combined with deep learning and natural language processing can better explore interactions among the rules and analyzing text based claim notes to boost fraud detection. 2.3 intelligent fraud detection Anti-fraud is generally a challenging area for data scientists. Not only the predictions need to be accurate but also they have to be interpretable and/or actionable. While rules based systems can break down a fraud score to triggered rules, it can be difficult to explain intuitively what a non-linear model does. Nonetheless, machine learning (ML) models often gain a non-trivial boost in prediction performance, and proper reason codes and visulizaitons can be created to support a prediction. More importantly, instead of second-guessing the scores coming out of a rule based system, those energies can be rechanneled to focus on handling of fraudulent claims such as evidence preparation and have proper preventative/remedial actions taken. It also makes more sense to make the SIU referral process more adaptive and robust while taking some pressure off claim ajusters and/or any labor-intensive manual process to tweak the rule-based systems.
